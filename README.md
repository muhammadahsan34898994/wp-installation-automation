![Domain Configuration](docs/images/28.png)

#### Install Certbot (Let's Encrypt)

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
```

Purpose: Installs Certbot, a tool for issuing free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.

![Certbot Installation](docs/images/29.png)

#### Generate and Install SSL Certificate

To secure the deployed WordPress website with HTTPS, Let's Encrypt SSL was configured using the following command:

```bash
sudo certbot --apache -d muhammad34898994.zapto.org
```

This command triggers Certbot to automatically configure SSL for the specified domain and update Apache's configuration.

**Step 1: Provide Email Address**

![Email Address](docs/images/30.png)

Certbot prompts for an email address to:
- Send expiration/renewal reminders.
- Provide urgent security notices.

Input Used: mydomaine.ges@gmail.com

This ensures you're notified before the SSL certificate expires (Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days).

**Step 2: Agree to Terms of Service**

![Terms of Service](docs/images/31.png)

Certbot displays its Terms of Service. You must agree to continue.
Choice Made: Y
Accepting registers you with the ACME server and enables Certbot to issue certificates.

**Step 3: Email Sharing Consent (Optional)**

![Email Sharing](docs/images/32.png)

Certbot asks if you want to share your email with the EFF (a Let's Encrypt partner) to receive digital freedom news.
Choice Made: Y
While optional, this helps support the open-source community behind the tool.

#### Final Output: Certificate Issued and HTTPS Enabled

![SSL Certificate Success](docs/images/33.png)

Certbot then:
- Generates an SSL certificate.
- Installs it under:
  - `/etc/letsencrypt/live/muhammad34898994.zapto.org/fullchain.pem` (certificate)
  - `/etc/letsencrypt/live/muhammad34898994.zapto.org/privkey.pem` (private key)
- Automatically updates Apache to serve HTTPS.

Final Message: Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://muhammad34898994.zapto.org

## IV. Script Explanation

### 1. Purpose and Motivation

The goal of the automation script is to streamline the deployment process of WordPress by consolidating all the repetitive manual commands into a single executable file. This enhances:

- **Efficiency:** Automates what would normally take several minutes.
- **Repeatability:** Ensures consistency across environments.
- **Scalability:** Can be reused for future deployments with minimal changes like password

The script replicates all the essential manual steps used in a standard WordPress installation. Instead of copying/pasting each command line-by-line, this script performs the entire setup in one go.

### 2. Script Location

The script is publicly hosted on GitHub:
URL: https://github.com/muhammadahsan34898994/wp-installation-automation/blob/main/install-wordpress.sh

![Script Location](docs/images/34.png)

### 3. How the Script Works (Step-by-Step)

**1) Download WordPress**

```bash
echo "Downloading WordPress..."
cd /tmp
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
```

Changes to the temporary directory and downloads the latest WordPress archive from the official source.

**2) Extract WordPress**

```bash
tar -xzf latest.tar.gz
```

Extracts the downloaded .tar.gz file to a folder named wordpress.

**3) Clean /var/www/html**

```bash
echo "Cleaning /var/www/html/..."
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
```

Removes any existing files in the web root directory to avoid conflicts.

**4) Move WordPress Files**

```bash
echo "Copying WordPress files to /var/www/html/..."
sudo cp -a wordpress/. /var/www/html/
```

Copies all WordPress files into Apache's root folder (/var/www/html).

**5) Remove Temporary Files**

```bash
echo "Cleaning up temporary files..."
rm -rf /tmp/wordpress /tmp/latest.tar.gz
```

Cleans up the downloaded archive and extracted folder to save space.

**6) Set Permissions**

```bash
echo "Setting ownership and permissions..."
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
```

Gives Apache (user: www-data) ownership of the WordPress files and sets proper directory permissions.

**7) Configure WordPress**

```bash
echo "Configuring WordPress..."
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm -f index.html
sudo mv wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
```

Removes any default placeholder (index.html) and renames the WordPress configuration sample file.

**8) Inject Database Credentials**

```bash
sudo sed -i "s/database_name_here/wordpress/" wp-config.php
sudo sed -i "s/username_here/wpuser/" wp-config.php
sudo sed -i "s/password_here/StrongP@ssw0rd!/" wp-config.php
sudo sed -i "s/localhost/localhost/" wp-config.php
```

Replaces placeholders in wp-config.php with actual database information.

**9) Restart Apache**

```bash
echo "Restarting Apache..."
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Restarts the Apache web server to ensure that all changes take effect and the WordPress site is now live.

**10) Output**

```bash
echo "WordPress is installed, configured, and ready to go!"
```

Displays a success message confirming the installation is complete.

This script converts the entire WordPress setup from a 10-minute manual job into a 20-second automated task ‚Äî perfect for bootstrapping, student demos, or lightweight client setups.

## V. Test Output

After developing and executing the WordPress installation script, a full test was performed to verify its effectiveness. The results confirm that the script:

- Downloads and installs WordPress correctly
- Configures the database credentials
- Sets proper file permissions
- Cleans up unnecessary files
- Restarts the Apache server
- Delivers a fully functional WordPress instance

## VI. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

This section outlines the infrastructure and service costs associated with deploying and maintaining the WordPress site. This setup was intentionally designed using free-tier eligible and open-source components to minimize cost while remaining production-capable

| Component | Service | Estimated Cost | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------|
| EC2 Instance (t2.micro) *2 | Amazon Web Services (AWS) | 0.00 $ (Free Tier) | 750 hours/month for 12 months under AWS Free Tier |
| Elastic IP *2 | AWS | 0.00 $ (if attached) | Free as long as it's assigned to a running EC2 instance |
| Storage (EBS, 20GB) | AWS | 0.00 $ (Free Tier) | Up to 30GB under Free Tier |
| Domain Name | No-IP | 0.00 $ | Free dynamic DNS domain (e.g., zapto.org) |
| SSL Certificate | Let's Encrypt | 0.00 $ | Free SSL via Certbot |
| WordPress | Open Source | 0.00 $ | Free CMS, self-hosted |
| OceanWP Theme | Free Theme | 0.00 $ | Used free version for template import |
| Additional Software | Apache, PHP, MySQL, Certbot ‚Ä¶ | 0.00 $ | Installed via Ubuntu APT repository |
| DNS Management | No-IP / EC2 public IP mapping | 0.00 $ | Handled through dynamic DNS setup |

**Total Monthly Cost: 0.00 $**

Note: These estimates assume use of the AWS Free Tier and open-source components. After the 12-month Free Tier period, EC2 + EBS storage may incur minor monthly charges (3$-10$/month depending on usage).

## VII. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how to deploy a secure, scalable, and publicly accessible WordPress site using AWS EC2, a free domain from No-IP, and open-source tools.
